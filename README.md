# Oscilloscope
This project built a simple oscilloscope by Labview,based on NI DAQ.
> The host computer designed in this paper mainly has the following characteristics:
>
> 1. It used the NI DAQmx function suite to read the contents of the NI data acquisition device;
> 2. It usd the XY graph to draw the waveform of the signal,and the waveform size can be adjusted and the X-axis labels correspond reasonably (**While the data buffer area of the waveform graph cannot be adjusted in the program panel, and the waveform size cannot be adjusted during operation,and the waveform graph can be adjusted by the incoming data size. Adjust the waveform size, but the X-axis labels are not adjustable**).
